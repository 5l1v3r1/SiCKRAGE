Right now this is\nprimarily used to upload debug symbols to Sentry if you are not using the\nfastlane tools.\n\n* Downloads can be found under\n  [Releases](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-cli/releases/)\n* Documentation can be found [here](https://docs.sentry.io/hosted/learn/cli/)\n\n## Installation\n\nThe recommended way to install is with everybody's favorite curl to bash:\n\n    curl -sL https://sentry.io/get-cli/ | bash\n\n### Node\n\nAdditionally you can also install this binary via npm:\n\n    npm install @sentry/cli\n\nWhen installing globally, make sure to have set\n[correct permissions on the global node_modules directory](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions).\nIf this is not possible in your environment or still produces an EACCESS error,\ninstall as root:\n\n    sudo npm install -g @sentry/cli --unsafe-perm\n\nBy default, this package will download sentry-cli from the CDN managed by [Fastly](https://www.fastly.com/).\nTo use a custom CDN, set the npm config property `sentrycli_cdnurl`. The downloader will append\n`\"/<version>/sentry-cli-<dist>\"`.\n\n```sh\nnpm install @sentry/cli --sentrycli_cdnurl=https://mymirror.local/path\n```\n\nOr add property into your `.npmrc` file (https://www.npmjs.org/doc/files/npmrc.html)\n\n```rc\nsentrycli_cdnurl=https://mymirror.local/path\n```\n\nAnother option is to use the environment variable `SENTRYCLI_CDNURL`.\n\n```sh\nSENTRYCLI_CDNURL=https://mymirror.local/path npm install @sentry/cli\n```\n\nIf you're installing the CLI with NPM from behind a proxy, the install script will\nuse either NPM's configured HTTPS proxy server, or the value from your `HTTPS_PROXY`\nenvironment variable.\n\n### Homebrew\n\nA homebrew recipe is provided in the `getsentry/tools` tap:\n\n    brew install getsentry/tools/sentry-cli\n\n### Docker\n\nAs of version _1.25.0_, there is an official Docker image that comes with\n`sentry-cli` preinstalled. If you prefer a specific version, specify it as tag.\nThe latest development version is published under the `edge` tag. In production,\nwe recommend you to use the `latest` tag. To use it, run:\n\n```sh\ndocker pull getsentry/sentry-cli\ndocker run --rm -v $(pwd):/work getsentry/sentry-cli --help\n```\n\n## Compiling\n\nIn case you want to compile this yourself, you need to install at minimum the\nfollowing dependencies:\n\n* Rust stable and Cargo\n* Make, CMake and a C compiler\n* OpenSSL 1.0.2n with development headers\n* Curl 7.50 with development headers\n\nUse cargo to compile:\n\n    $ cargo build\n\nIn case you get OpenSSL errors you need to compile with the path to the OpenSSL\nheaders. For instance:\n\n    $ CFLAGS=-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include/ cargo build\n\nAlso, there is a Dockerfile that builds an Alpine-based Docker image with\n`sentry-cli` in the PATH. To build and use it, run:\n\n```sh\ndocker build -t sentry-cli .\ndocker run --rm -v $(pwd):/work sentry-cli --help\n```\n",
