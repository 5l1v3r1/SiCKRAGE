[Downloading](https://github.com/jquery-validation/jquery-validation/archive/master.zip) or Forking this repository\n 2. [Setup the build](CONTRIBUTING.md#build-setup)\n 3. Run `grunt` to create the built files in the \"dist\" directory\n\n### Including it on your page\n\nInclude jQuery and the plugin on a page. Then select a form to validate and call the `validate` method.\n\n```html\n<form>\n\t<input required>\n</form>\n<script src=\"jquery.js\"></script>\n<script src=\"jquery.validate.js\"></script>\n<script>\n    $(\"form\").validate();\n</script>\n```\n\nAlternatively include jQuery and the plugin via requirejs in your module.\n\n```js\ndefine([\"jquery\", \"jquery.validate\"], function( $ ) {\n\t$(\"form\").validate();\n});\n```\n\nFor more information on how to setup a rules and customizations, [check the documentation](https://jqueryvalidation.org/documentation/).\n\n## Reporting issues and contributing code\n\nSee the [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT EMAIL VALIDATION**. As of version 1.12.0 this plugin is using the same regular expression that the [HTML5 specification suggests for browsers to use](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/forms.html#valid-e-mail-address). We will follow their lead and use the same check. If you think the specification is wrong, please report the issue to them. If you have different requirements, consider [using a custom method](https://jqueryvalidation.org/jQuery.validator.addMethod/).\nIn case you need to adjust the built-in validation regular expression patterns, please [follow the documentation](https://jqueryvalidation.org/jQuery.validator.methods/).\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT REQUIRED METHOD**. As of version 1.14.0 this plugin stops trimming white spaces from the value of the attached element. If you want to achieve the same result, you can use the [`normalizer`](https://jqueryvalidation.org/normalizer/) that can be used to transform the value of an element before validation. This feature was available since `v1.15.0`. In other words, you can do something like this:\n``` js\n$(\"#myForm\").validate({\n\trules: {\n\t\tusername: {\n\t\t\trequired: true,\n\t\t\t// Using the normalizer to trim the value of the element\n\t\t\t// before validating it.\n\t\t\t//\n\t\t\t// The value of `this` inside the `normalizer` is the corresponding\n\t\t\t// DOMElement. In this example, `this` references the `username` element.\n\t\t\tnormalizer: function(value) {\n\t\t\t\treturn $.trim(value);\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t}\n\t}\n});\n```\n\n## License\nCopyright &copy; Jörn Zaefferer<br>\nLicensed under the MIT license.\n",
