pyUnRAR2 is a ctypes based wrapper around the free UnRAR.dll. 

It is an modified version of Jimmy Retzlaff's pyUnRAR - more simple,
stable and foolproof.
Notice that it has INCOMPATIBLE interface.

It enables reading and unpacking of archives created with the
RAR/WinRAR archivers. There is a low-level interface which is very
similar to the C interface provided by UnRAR. There is also a
higher level interface which makes some common operations easier.
